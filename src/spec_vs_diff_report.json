  "summary": "REQ-46 asks for a fresh rebuild/deploy with no functional or user-facing changes. The diff adds a rebuild-trigger file and a build-trigger comment (which can force a new artifact), but it does not provide evidence of an actual deployment/live promotion. The diff also shows multiple modified source/metadata files beyond a minimal rebuild trigger, which appear unrelated to a deployment-only request.",
