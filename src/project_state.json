  "architectural_notes": [
    "Use Internet Identity principals for authentication; store a per-principal unique username on first login.",
    "Enforce role-based access: assistants can access only their own overtime entries; manager can access all assistants and audit logs.",
    "Shared to-do list is global/shared state; audit log is immutable and manager-only.",
    "Implement i18n with Dutch/French/English strings.",
    "To-do list becomes the default post-login landing page with navigation to overtime/manager views.",
    "Support daily/weekly/monthly recurring tasks with computed next-due-date and urgency-based sorting; pinned tasks override sorting.",
    "Implement real-time to-do updates via polling or websocket-like approach if feasible on the platform.",
    "Task completion can include comment + photo; store high-quality images with compression/limits (not thumbnails-only); validate JPEG/PNG and enforce size limits.",
    "Add a per-task immutable history ledger visible to all users; keep separate from manager-only global audit log.",
